RPiHost for the Raspberry Pi 2 on Windows 10 IoT
=============
This is a first attempt to re-use code from CreationWorkshop on windows 10 IoT.

Using the Raspberry Pi 2:
- HDMI for displaying sliced images for a certain timeIntervall 
- USB port to connect to the adruino for motion


Installation
-----------
For now you can use the Solution file to compile and deploy within visual studio 2015.
a next step is to make available a Raspberry Pi 2 Image with pre installed application

How is this RPiHost used
-----
from a CreationWorkshop running from the windows machine the slices are created.
these slices are uploaded to the Raspberry pi 2 and when the trigger 'start print' the slices will be displayed on the screen.

Todo
-----
V0.0000001
The current version only retrieves a slice from the windows WCF host.

More will be updated here
